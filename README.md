# 💯 Project: 100 Days of Code

This repository contains the code I wrote during my attempt to complete the **100 Days of Code** challenge led by Dr. Angela Yu, a senior developer and educator.

## 🧠 Purpose

The challenge was designed to help me:
- Build consistency in coding practice  
- Explore Python fundamentals and small projects  
- Develop discipline and momentum in my learning journey

## 🗂️ Status

This was an early experiment in my transition toward AI engineering.  
While the challenge was not completed, it played a role in shaping my current roadmap and mindset.

**This repo is now archived and not actively maintained.**
